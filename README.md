Overcoming Geographic Isolation: The Design and Implementation of a Web-based Collaborative Learning Environment
=================================================================================================================

Abstract
--------

A web-based Collaborative Environment is designed and implemented that serves as both _1)_ a solution to overcoming the challenges of operating a STEM outreach program in geographically isolated, rural areas; and _2)_ a tool for further research into web-based (cyber) learning environments.

This effort is in alignment with what the National Science Foundation has deemed to be a key research topic in the area of cyberlearning: the collection, analysis, and management of cyberlearning system usage data.

Students in need of educational assistance, when meeting in-person is not possible, can engage in personalized web-based learning with a tutor using assessments and materials backed by state standards. Educators can create surveys to receive feedback from targets regardless of their location while parents have access to their children's data and program information. Additionally, data logged about students and their usage of the system can be used in future analyses and reports.

The Collaborative Environment's feature set has been crafted to fit the requirements of IMPETUS, a STEP program serving rural Northern New York. A usability study was performed via a survey distributed to current IMPETUS participants to verify the system design and gather an initial set of qualitative data for future quantification.
