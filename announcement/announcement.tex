\textbf{Abstract}
\end{center}

A web-based Collaborative Environment for IMPETUS is described that is designed to increase the convenience and accessibility of collaboration in Northern New York, an area with a low population density, large land area, and a small amount of federal financial assistance. Students in need of educational assistance, when meeting in-person is not possible, can engage in personalized web-based learning with a tutor using assessments and materials backed by state standards. Educators can create surveys to receive feedback from targets regardless of their location. Parents have access to their children’s data and program information. Additionally, data logged about students and their usage of the system can be used in future analyses and reports. A usability study was performed via a survey distributed to current IMPETUS participants to verify the system design and gather an initial set of qualitative data for future quantification.
